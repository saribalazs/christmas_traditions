    <h1>Christmas in Canada</h1>
    <p>
        Canada is a very large country and people of many different cultural backgrounds live there. <br> Because of this, there are lots of different Christmas traditions in Canada. <br> Many of the traditions and celebrations come from French, English, Irish, Scottish, German, Norwegian, Ukrainian . <br> People in Canada send Christmas Cards to their friends and family. <br>

        Many Canadians open their gifts on Christmas Eve. <br> Some only open their stocking on Christmas Eve. Others choose one gift to open, then save the rest until Christmas Day. <br>
        
        Canadians like to decorate their houses with Christmas Trees, lights and other decorations. <br> There's often Christmas stockings hung by the fireplace, ready for Santa! <br>
        However, people from different backgrounds and cultures have their own favorite foods at     Christmas. <br>
        Going skiing, skating and tobogganing are also popular if there's snow at Christmas!

    <h1>Christmas meal</h1>
    <p>
        In English-speaking Canada, Christmas dinner is similar to that of Britain. <br> Traditional Christmas dinner features turkey with stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, and vegetables. <br> Other types of poultry, roast beef, or ham, are also used. <br> Pumpkin or apple pie, raisin pudding, Christmas pudding, or fruitcake are staples for dessert. <br> Eggnog, a milk-based punch often infused with alcohol, is also popular around the holiday season. <br> Other Christmas items include Christmas cookies, butter tarts, and shortbread, which are traditionally <br> baked before the holidays and served to visiting friends at Christmas and New Year parties, as well as on Christmas Day. <br>

        In French-speaking Canada, traditions may be more like those of France. (See RÃ©veillon.) <br> Other ethnic communities may continue to use old-world traditions as well.
